            <h2 class="sub-heading">BACKGROUND</h2>
            <p>
                I graduated from the University of Virginia (UVA) in 2024 with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science with a 3.45 GPA. I chose UVA because of 3 primary reasons:
                location, financials, and reputation.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have lived in Virginia my entire life and never really considered where I was going to go to college until it became time to start applying. 
                Therefore, I just mass applied to schools in Virginia and some out of state schools that I had heard in passing. My strategy was to backload 
                researching the schools that I got into instead of wasting time that could be spent preparing for IB exams. Coincidentally, UVA was the first school
                to send back their decision. I was accepted into UVA's College of Arts and Sciences, a decision I made rashly, thinking I was going to go to school for 
                some sort of business/economics degree.
            </p>
            <p>
                After researching tuition and financial-adjacent information, it was clear that UVA was unbeatable. Because I was an in-state student, I was able to attend
                for zero-cost. This was a big deal for me, as I was very hesitant to pay for schooling in the first place. I almost-nearly accepted the offer on the spot,
                still very early in the cycle. My intuition was that although I could get into (arguably?) better schools, there really wasn't a point in paying for them.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I mentioned earlier, I was planning on going to school for something business degree related. I had literally zero exposure to computer science before,
                so UVA's CS program was not a factor in my decision. The reputation for their commerce school is what initially sealed the deal for me. However, after 
                simply one semester of the commerce school's intro class, I had completely lost any interest in going forward with it. That first semester, I took an
                intro philosophy, intro Chinese language, intro economics, intro CS, intro commerce, and some random math class that I was going to need to graduate 4 
                years later. My strategy for the next semester was continue the branches of classes I enjoyed, and replace the ones I didn't with completely unrelated classes. 
                My second semester, the only continuous branch left was CS and philosophy.  
            </p>
            <h2 class="sub-heading">ASIDES/INTERESTS/RANDOM</h2>
            <p>
                Relating to CS, I am mostly interested in network security, network architecture, and anti-cheat software. Unrelating to CS, I am interested in ICE-powered
                vehicles and their systems, innovative music/art/clothing, and computers. I enjoy mostly anything that could be construed as competitive.
