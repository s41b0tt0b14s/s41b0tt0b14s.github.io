                <!-- text describing project-->
                The main goal of this project was to familiarize myself with creating a full application. Frontend is Next.js (built on React), some CSS and JS/TSX. I chose Next.js because I was interested in figuring out how to deploy something with Vercel, and its' tight integration with Vercel seemed appropriate.
                Backend is using Supabase, a free service that did everything I wanted to do. Serves as authentication (OAuth), database, and storage. Mentioned previously, I used Vercel to host and deploy. Configured DNS settings to point to the Vercel app using a subdomain to get the most out of my money.

                Must note that I did not have a focus on design/UI at all. That type of stuff doesn't interest me, no matter how hard I try to like it. Maybe I'll revisit at some point to make it look better, or add more features. Try it out, it's very simple-looking and isn't feature rich.

                Written in Rust because it seems thats what everyone wants to talk about. I don't like it very much. I got inspiration to try this project because of an anectdote I read online where someone was contracted to write an enterprise filehosting software for a company. Currently, I am bored with it, and moved on to an idea that came to me. For when that happens, 
                I need to link it with an actual database, and I would like to add user/role management for resource permissions. Maybe also a viewer for more file types. I learned what I wanted to learn, so it'll sit for now.
